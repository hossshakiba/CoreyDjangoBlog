#CoreyDjangoBlog
@CoreyMSchafer is a well-known Youtuber, developer and a perfect instructor who has a beginner to intermediate, useful Django course on Youtube.
This blog is forked from @jithinpgopal 's repository which was exactly what Corey has done in his tutorials.
I tried to make it a more professional social blog with new features. Hope it comes handy for those out there, who are interested in beautiful Django.
