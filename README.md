# CoreyDjangoBlog 
@CoreyMSchafer is a well-known Youtuber, developer and a perfect instructor who has a beginner to intermediate, useful Django course on Youtube.
This blog is forked from @jithinpgopal 's repository which was exactly what Corey has done in his tutorials.
I tried to make it a more professional social blog with new features. Hope it comes handy for those out there, who are interested in beautiful Django. :yellow_heart: :blue_heart:

## What's New?(as far as now)
* Authentication Validators
* Rich Text Editor (django-tinymmce, but modified this package too!)
* Code Sample (more languages than what default tiny-mce provides)
